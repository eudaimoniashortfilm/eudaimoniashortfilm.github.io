            <p class="flow-text justify">A film with women in charge of almost every aspect of production, <strong>Eudaimonia</strong> embodies the progress of cinema to include and celebrate women behind the camera as well as in front of it. 
            <br><br>
            From its inception <strong>Eudaimonia</strong> set out to encounter womanhood and happiness, with the ultimate conclusion that a balance between rationality and emotion are fundamental to happiness for any human being. Drawing on classical allegory, the world is one of extremes. Extreme control over every aspect of life is fundamental to the Order of this world. Repetition and sameness add to the nightmarish reality of the convent, where one young woman experiences an awakening. 
 
            <br><br>
            The script was a collaboration between Nell Cunningham and Juri Krutii. Following that they formed the producing and directing team, getting on board Claire Murphy and Igua Curial as directors of photography and Siiri Korhonen as production designer. This strong female core shaped the film and helped to create a production environment that was inclusive and enjoyable for all involved. The film is one that everyone is immensely proud of, and as a student film it stands as a testament to the power of positive learning experiences through practice.

            German/American Nell Cunningham studied Film and Visual Culture and Philosophy at the University of Aberdeen and continued her education at the University of Edinburgh completing an MSc in Film Exhibition and Curation. During this time she began to collaborate with Juri Krutii on academic and experimental film projects. She further engaged with her passion for archive film through a Traineeship in Film Archiving. Inspired by current events and strong female historical figures, Nell seeks to engage and provoke the audience, by rejecting mindless consumption of the image. <strong>Eudaimonia</strong> represents her first attempt at creating an original work with this aim.
